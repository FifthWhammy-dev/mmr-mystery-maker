Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.3
Major changes
- The Fairy Hunt settings file now enables Detect Stray Fairies (shimmering GF Mask).
- The Fairy Hunt settings file now gives no foolish hints (instead of 3).
- In Fairy Hunt seeds, Boss Keys are never shuffled.
- The Mystery Settings document now clarifies that Potsanity's Temples and Side Dungeons setting
  includes Secret Shrine (new full list: Woodfall Temple, Snowhead Temple, Deku Palace, 
  Pirates' Fortress, Ocean Spider House, Beneath the Well, Ikana Castle, and Secret Shrine). 
  This was true in previous seeds, but undocumented.

Script changes
- The script now accounts for the input settings' WotH and Foolish counts when determining how many
  Gossip Stone hint slots are free for extra always hints.

Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.2
Bug fixes
- Removed Pirates' Fortress Barrel Maze Egg Pot 1 and 2 from Crates and Barrels, as intended.

Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.1
Major changes
- Updated base settings files for MMR v1.16.0.10 compatibility.
  * For default Mystery and Remains Shuffle, Oath and Boss Remains hints are enabled.
  * For Fairy Hunt, Fairy and Skull hints are enabled.

Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.0

Major changes
- Remains Shuffle and Fairy Hunt settings now are specially supported by the mystery script!
  Giving the script an MMR settings file with all remains shuffled will activate Fairy Hunt mode
  (if Boss Remains Mode is also set to Great Fairy Remains) or Remains Shuffle mode (otherwise)
- Extra base settings files are included for Remains Shuffle and Fairy Hunt. To make Fairy Hunt
  more race-friendly, special win conditions are in effect.
  * Remains Shuffle matches default settings, except that remains are shuffled.
    Tatl will hint the remains' regions at the start of a cycle.
  * In the Fairy Hunt settings file, all Stray Fairies are shuffled and junked, and all remains are
    shuffled and placed on Great Fairy Rewards. Victory Mode is set to Three Boss Remains and
    Direct To Credits; turning in *three* full sets of fairies wins the game *immediately*!
    The Fairy Fountains will hint the stray fairies' regions.
- Certain categories and weights have been changed. See below for details.

Category changes
- Gossip Fairies is now disabled in default settings (30% -> 0%).
  Gossip Fairies can require major backtracking if Epona's and Healing are found later in the seed;
  delaying gossip visits until then is not viable at all due to gossip hints' importance in Mystery.
  Given that the checks require many extra song plays in any event, and that most gossips are already
  routed in anyway, the category isn't interesting enough to justify the added tedium and play time
  for race-appropriate settings.
- Butterfly Fairies is now Butterfly and Well Fairies. Decreased weight (30% -> 20%).
  The "Well Fairies" are the eight floating fairies in Beneath the Well's left side fairy fountain,
  which requires Blue Potion (and water, and a bug) to reach. Adding these to Butterfly Fairies keeps
  runners from having to blindly visit the well fairy fountain every seed.
  The remaining 1.16 floating fairy checks (in pots and a barrel) could be added in future versions
  should there be both interest from players and a resource to point players to the checks.
- Crates and Barrels no longer shuffles Great Bay Temple Entrance Room Barrel, which has a
  floating fairy.
  This is to make Crates and Barrels consistent with Snowsanity and Potsanity, which don't include
  snowballs/pots that give floating fairies in vanilla.
- The Late Shopsanity option no longer shuffles the Ocean and Canyon Scrub Purchases.
  This halves the chance of the Canyon Scrub's Blue Potion being shuffled (40% -> 20%) which helps
  make left side well access more straightforward on average in the wake of Well Fairies being added.
- Hit Spots now shuffles Swordsman School Gong.
  In West Clock Town, strike the Swordsman School Gong at the top or bottom of any hour (xx:00 or
  xx:30). This is in logic with any transformation mask or the Kokiri Sword.
- When Scoopsanity and Soilsanity are both active, Bottle: Bug is not shuffled.
  Soilsanity requires 15 bugs, one for each check; gathering that many could take prohibitive
  amounts of time if Bottle: Bug is placed on a late or low-quantity scoop like Bottle: Big Poe.
- Scoopsanity now adds Bottle: Big Poe as a tier 2 hint instead of Bottle: Deku Princess.
  Bottle: Deku Princess is checkable (or Blitz-junked) over the course of every seed, whereas
  Bottle: Big Poe's locations are much less regularly visited.
- When Songsanity is not active, Long Quests is less likely to add Baby Zoras (20% -> 10% total) and
  more likely to add Frog Choir (20% -> 30% total).
  Even when enabled, it's uncommon for a long quest to become relevant in a seed, as a required item
  needs to be placed on it. This isn't true of Baby Zoras with Songsanity off, which will very often
  have a required song. Of the other two long quests, Frog Choir is the better candidate to get the
  extra weight in this case, as it's vulnerable to Blitz-junking (very much so if Frogs aren't
  shuffled!)
- Frogs now adds Frog in Great Bay Temple as a tier 2 hint (previously unhinted).
  This is the least accessible of the four frogs and the most inconvenient frog to revisit if
  Don Gero's Mask is found late in a seed.
- The All Notebook Entries option now adds Postman's Freedom as a tier 3 hint (formerly tier 2).
  This ensures that all seeds continue to include all tier 2 hints (even if Cowsanity + Scoopsanity +
  + Frogs + All Notebook Entries are all shuffled!).

Script options
- The script now detects Remains Shuffle and Fairy Hunt settings in base settings files
  and will adjust accordingly.
- Remains Shuffle will be active if the base settings file shuffles all boss remains.
  Remains Shuffle seeds will never give starting boss remains: the Starting Boss Remains category
  is disabled and reaching the hard option maximum will not add an extra remains.
- Fairy Hunt will be active if the base settings file sets Boss Remains Mode to "Great Fairy Rewards".
  When Fairy Hunt is active:
  * All 60 Dungeon Stray Fairies are shuffled and junked.
  * Starting Boss Remains and reaching the hard option maximum give extra starting Stray Fairies
    instead of remains. Blitz will not be set.
    + One starting boss remains becomes three Stray Fairies from each set.
    + Two starting boss remains become five Stray Fairies from each set.
  * The Stray Fairies category is still rolled; when active, it will unjunk the corresponding 
    dungeon Stray Fairies. The Clock Town Stray Fairy is still added as normal.
